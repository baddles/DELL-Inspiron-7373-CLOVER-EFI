# DELL-Inspiron-7373-CLOVER-EFI
For EFI use

27/04/2019 Note: This EFI is not meant to be used to boot into your macOS with your 7373, because I haven't update anything (kexts, DSDT, etc.) in ages.
I originally public this for I2C touchscreen issue at https://github.com/konrad11901/Inspiron7373-macOS/issues/2 and some weird quirks that happen with ACPI.
If you want to use premade EFI, better make it by yourself.
If you open an issue here regarding any problem by using my EFI, I will slap you.
